PodJelly is a tool currently in development for generating transcriptions of a podcast/RSS-based audio feed from an RSS file.
The parsing and transcription service is operational. Future developments are planned in the order listed:

 1. Persistent database for transcript storage along with metadata (episode number, length, tags, etc).
 2. Front end web application for viewing transcripts (React.js)
 3. Automation of ingest process
 4. Add searching feature for specific words/phrases from transcript
